# Overhead Crane Gearbox Design

**Project Overview**

This project aims to design a gearbox for an overhead crane, adhering to AGMA and CMAA74 standards. The gearbox will be designed to meet the following specifications:

* **Maximum load capacity:** 1360 kg (2999 lbs)
* **Load carrying linear speed:** 20 m/min (787.4 in/min)

**Design Process**

1. **Motor Selection:** A suitable electric motor will be selected from Motojen Tabriz based on the problem data.
2. **Output Shaft Diameter Estimation:** An initial diameter for the output shaft will be estimated based on the load.
3. **Gear Ratio and Tooth Number Calculation:** The appropriate gear ratio will be calculated, and the number of teeth for each gear will be determined. The performance of the selected motor in step 1 will be evaluated.
4. **Complete Gear Design:** All details related to gear design, such as module, pressure angle, number of teeth, and tooth profile, will be determined and drawn.
5. **Overall Gearbox Layout:** The overall layout of the gearbox will be drawn, considering the dimensions of gears, shafts, and other components.
6. **Shaft Design:** The gearbox shafts will be designed based on the applied loads and stress and deformation limitations, and the initial diameter estimated in step 2 will be verified and corrected.
7. **Bearing Design and Selection:** Suitable bearings will be selected from the SKF catalog, and their design will be carried out considering the loads applied to the shafts.
8. **Engineering Drawings:** Detailed engineering drawings will be prepared for manufacturing.
